## Setup Guide

### **Pre-Launch Checklist**

1. Ensure a Thunderbolt 3.0 (or higher) cable connects the [XDAQ AIO](https://www.kontex.io/xdaq) and the computer. 
2. Verify that the connectors are firmly seated.
3. Confirm all cameras are firmly connected to the [XDAQ AIO](https://www.kontex.io/xdaq).
4. Connect a [Brainwave simulator](https://www.kontex.io/product/Brainwave-Simulator) to the [XDAQ AIO](https://www.kontex.io/xdaq) using a 3.5mm jack to BNC wire.
5. Connect the 3.5mm Jack to the "Pulse" port on the [Brainwave simulator](https://www.kontex.io/product/Brainwave-Simulator).
6. Connect the BNC to the Digital In port on the front panel of the [XDAQ AIO](https://www.kontex.io/xdaq).

### **Launch Sequence**

Follow this exact order:

1. Power on [XDAQ AIO](https://www.kontex.io/xdaq).
2. Launch [Open Ephys GUI](https://open-ephys.org/gui) or [XDAQ-RHX](https://github.com/kontex-neuro/Intan-RHX) first.
3. Wait until the chosen application finishes its initialization.
4. Launch ThorVision.
5. Allow 1–2 minutes for ThorVision to connect.
6. If the connection fails, retry the entire [launch sequence](#launch-sequence) from the start.

### **Camera Setup**

1. Once ThorVision connects to the [XDAQ AIO](https://www.kontex.io/xdaq), check the [camera status panel](#1-camera-status) to confirm all connected cameras are listed. If not, check the cable connections.

    - **INFO:** Before assigning `Quality` and `Codec`, you can still hot-plug cameras to the [XDAQ AIO](https://www.kontex.io/xdaq). It may take a few seconds for the [XDAQ AIO](https://www.kontex.io/xdaq) to recognize a newly connected camera.

    !["Camera Setup 1"](camera-setup-1.png)

2. On the right panel in ThorVision, assign a unique name, `Quality` and `Codec` to the selected camera. **Before recording, make sure every camera on the list has both a `Quality` and a `Codec` assigned.**

/// tip | Tip
* If the preview stream doesn't appear within 10 seconds, re-select the same `Quality` / `Codec` settings to refresh the view.

* If the camera-naming function behaves abnormally, restart the ThorVision interface and try again.
///

/// warning | IMPORTANT
- Do **NOT** assign the same name to different cameras. This can cause file overwrites during recording sessions.

- Do **NOT** change `Quality` / `Codec` once the preview has started. This can cause the camera to freeze.

</ol>

/// warning | IMPORTANT
When restarting a recording session, **WAIT 5 SECONDS** after stopping before pressing the record button again. Do not consecutively press the button more than one time!

## Recording Tips

Configure the camera’s recording settings to view the real time camera feed. The same settings will also be applied to video recording.

!["Camera Setup 4"](camera-setup-4.png)

Press the **`REC`** button to start recording on all connected cameras simultaneously. The Stop Recording button works the same way. In the pop-up window, you can review the recording specifications. Use unique camera names only.

!["Camera Setup 5"](camera-setup-5.png)

If XDAQ is disconnected, ThorVision will automatically stop recording.

!["Camera Setup 6"](camera-setup-6.png)

You must stop recording before closing the ThorVision app.

## **Golden Rules (TL; DR)**

- Launch Order is Critical: [XDAQ AIO](https://www.kontex.io/xdaq) >>> [OE GUI](https://open-ephys.org/gui) / [RHX](https://github.com/kontex-neuro/Intan-RHX) >>> ThorVision.
- Set the `Quality` / `Codec` once and never change it during the session.
- Use unique camera names only.
- Do not hot-plug cameras while recording.
- Wait at least 5 seconds after stopping a recording before starting a new one.
